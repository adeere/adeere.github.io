	<h3>Motivation</h3>	
      <p>I chose to do this topic because I am very interested in how climate change will affect humans. I am a third year atmospheric science student and have spent a lot of time in class discussing climate change from a scientific point of view: How much will the sea-level rise? How will the temperature change? What will happen to ice in Northern Canada? As such, I have not spent that much time in classes looking at the human impact of climate change. Through this project, I hoped to learn how a rising sea level would affect residents of Vancouver. Further than that, I wanted to see if there was a relationship between wealth and the level of impact. Do people with a lower income have more of a chance of their lives being turned upside down from a rise in the sea level?  </p>
	<p> I think that this issue is especially important in Vancouver. The lower east side has a very low elevation compared to say, Point Grey. If people living in the lower east side, which ahs the most homelssness, overdoeses, and overall a highly vulnerable population are maybe at a higher risk during a climate disaster, that must be mitigated. It is even clear today, during COVID-19, people with higher vulnerabilities (not just health), are at a much higher risk than people with higher incomes, stable savings and can afford to ride on their savings for a bit.</p>

	<h3>Sea Level Height</h3>	
		<p>In my research for this project, I came across an article written by Emily Nixon, a SOMETHING for the BC SOMETHING. It went over her way of looking at vulnerable people and sea level rise. In her article, she proposed three sea level changes. A level of 0.09 m, 0.88 m, and 6 m. The level of 0.09 m is defined as expected. The level of 0.88 m is defined as worst case scenario, and the level of 6 m is defined as catastrophic. </p>
