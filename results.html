	<h3>Bivariate Choropleth Map</h3>	
		<p>These are my two bivariate choropleth maps. The left is median income and elevation, and the right is median monthly rental cost and elevation. The areas with low income/monthly rent and low elevation are coloured pale green/yellow. We can see the palest colour mainly in Richmond, and sprinkled in a few other places. We can see low elevation and a slightly higher rent/income in many places around Vancouver as well. This map shows that there could be a relationship between where we see low elevations, and low income/rent. This alone however, is not enough to confirm that there is a spatial relationship. </p>

	<h3>Conclusion </h3>	
		<p>Taken altogether, the results I came to lead to the conclusion that there may be a relationship between elevation and vulnerability. I did not analyze enough variables to be certain of that relationship, and did not create a vulnerability index. Given the background research that is included here, I would say it is extremely likely that there is a relationship between elevation and vulnerability, specifically that individuals with a higher social vulnerability index are at a higher risk of having their lives uprooted by climate change. By not having the resources required to bounce back from a disaster, to not having stable shelter, potentially living at lower elevations, the upper class will end up on top during climate change. These issues are magnified today, in a pandemic, individuals with higher vulnerability are put at the highest risk. Homeless individuals have a much tougher time self-isolating during COVID-19 than individuals who can afford shelter. </p>

	<h3>Further Ideas</h3>	
		<p>In the future I would love to come back to this project. I would like to learn enough about vulnerabilities and how they affect individuals to feel comfortable creating a vulnerability index. In addition, I would like to look at other cities in more depth. I briefly looked at New York, and Miami, when trying to compare Vancouver to other cities, and I think it would be very interesting to look at similar issues affecting other cities, with higher populations and at an increased risk to sea-level rise.
